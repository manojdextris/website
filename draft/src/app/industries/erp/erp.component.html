                     The <b>DEXTRIS</b> support team can provide assistance with your upgrade or expansion project, based on your
                      specific needs. <br>
                      We will work with your company to ensure a smooth transition to the latest version. We offer many 
                      levels of upgrade assistance based on each customerâ€™s needs. Some companies have a full IT staff who
                       can handle the upgrade on their own, while others need our team to drive the upgrade process.
                    <br>Choice Brands Adhesives needed to upgrade in order to scale with their rapidly growing business.
                     With the help of our Support Team, they were able to get all of their many facilities upgraded without
